* Methods for Adding CSS
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: methods-for-adding-css
  :END:
In this exercise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file
using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. You
should only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles
via the external and internal methods. You should also use keywords for
colors (e.g.Â "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.

Edit: So the rules are:

1. Only *type* selectors, and
2. Only *named* colors.

There are three elements for you to add styles to, each of which uses a
different method of adding CSS to it, as noted in the outcome image
below. All other exercises in this section will have a CSS file provided
and linked for you, but for this exercise you will have to create the
file and link it in the HTML file yourself. This is all about practicing
using these different methods and getting the syntax right.

  Do not worry about details in these exercises that are not
  specifically mentioned in the exercise or self check section. Because
  the desired outcomes are screenshots, your browser may show a
  different font, the colors may appear different on your machine, or
  the spacing between elements may look different. Only concern yourself
  with the specific items you are supposed to be learning for each
  exercise.

The properties you need to add to each element are:

- =div=: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center
  aligned, and bold
- =p=: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
- =button=: an orange background and a font size of 18px
