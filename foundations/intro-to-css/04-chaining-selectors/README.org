* Chaining Selectors

We start by tangling =style.css=.
We'll be using *chaining* for the selectors, and we'll need two declaration blocks.

[[file:style.css][style.css]] ≡

#+begin_src css :tangle style.css
.avatar.proportioned {
  <<avapro>>
}

.avatar.distorted {
  <<avadis>>
}
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
- Make the element with both the =avatar= and =proportioned= classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
#+end_quote

~<<avapro>> +≡~

#+begin_src css :noweb-ref avapro
width: 300px;
height: auto;
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
- Make the element with both the =avatar= and =distorted= classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).
#+end_quote

~<<avadis>> +≡~

#+begin_src css :noweb-ref avadis
width: 200px;
height: 400px;
#+end_src
