* A Basic Header
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: a-basic-header
  :END:
Use flexbox rules to create this very common webpage header style. The
benefit to using flex here is that everything should be /flexible/.
Check out the two screenshots below to get an idea of how it should
scale with your screen. Besides flex rules, you'll also want to add some
rules for margin and padding. (Hint: =ul=s have some default
margin/padding that you will need to deal with.)

** Desired Outcome

*** Self Check
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: self-check
    :END:
- There is space between all items and the edge of the header (specific
  px amount doesn't matter here).

- Logo is centered vertically and horizontally.

- list-items are horizontal, and are centered vertically inside the
  header.

- left-links and right-links are pushed all the way to the left and
  right, and stay at the edge of the header when the page is resized.

- Your solution does not use floats, inline-block, or absolute
  positioning.

- Note: For this exercise, it's completely acceptable to not match the
  font-family.
