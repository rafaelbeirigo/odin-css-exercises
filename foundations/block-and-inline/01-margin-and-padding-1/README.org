* Margin and Padding practice

#+begin_quote
For this first exercise, simply edit the =style.css= file so that the
divs look like the image below. Only edit the CSS where instructed in
the file. You should only have to change the values of the margin and
padding for this exercise. You should not have to add or remove
properties in the CSS, or touch the HTML.

Use this section to check your work. On /these/ projects, your goal
isn't to attain 100% pixel perfection, but to use the tools you've
learned to get relatively close to the desired output.

- Div One and Div Three have 32px between their text and border.
- Div One has 12px between it and any other element on the page.
- There is a 48px gap between Div Two and Div Three.
- Div Three is aligned to the right.
- Div Three's alignment is achieved using =margin= (and not float,
  flexbox, etc.).
