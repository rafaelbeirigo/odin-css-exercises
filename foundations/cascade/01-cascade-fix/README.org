* CSS Methods

The rules of this assignment:

#+begin_quote
You can edit the CSS file by adding, removing, or editing selectors for a declaration block, or by moving declaration blocks around.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
*You should not edit the HTML file or any of the actual styles in the CSS*.
#+end_quote

Let's start with the /buttons/.
First the *Confirm* one.

From =index.html=:

#+begin_src html
<button id="confirm-button" class="button confirm">Confirm</button>
#+end_src

From =style.css=, the rules applied to *Confirm* are, in order:

#+begin_src css
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

.confirm {
  background: green;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.button {
  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
  font-size: 20px;
}
#+end_src

Let's analyze the resolution of those rules.
As they have the same priority---both selectors are /classes/---the *last defined* rule is applied.
This is why *Confirm* does not get a green background, as it should.
This is fixed by swapping those declaration blocks.
