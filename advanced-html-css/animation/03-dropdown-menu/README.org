We've set up a dropdown menu in this exercise. Load up the page, you can
see a single menu title, with a dropdown menu that will open upon
clicking on the title.

Your task is to add animation to the dropdown menu so that it will have
an effect of expanding. Check out the desired outcome below, and notice
the /bounce/ illusion when the dropdown expands close to its final end
state.
